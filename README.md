## Overview

Welcome to the Online Malware Analysis Bootcamp from CSC HTU. This bootcamp is designed to introduce you to the fascinating world of malware analysis, where you'll learn to understand, analyze, and mitigate malware threats. 

Our approach combines theoretical understanding with hands-on experience, making learning both comprehensive and practical.

## What is Malware Analysis?

Malware analysis is the art and science of examining malicious software. It involves understanding the behavior, purpose, and impact of malware to develop effective defense strategies. 

By dissecting malware, analysts can determine how it works, how to identify it, and how to protect against it.

## Bootcamp Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of various malware types and their behaviors.
- Develop skills in both static and dynamic analysis of malware.
- Learn to use industry-standard tools like IDA Pro and OllyDbg for in-depth analysis.
- Enhance critical thinking and analytical skills in cybersecurity.

## Textbook

We highly recommend "Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig. You can purchase it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Dissecting-Malicious/dp/1593272901).

## Quizzes

Quizzes are an integral part of this bootcamp. They are multiple-choice, online, and open-book.
